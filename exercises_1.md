# Exercises 1

1. Define three variables (values are a string, a negative integer, and a float). Use `p` to print each of the values to terminal. Run the file with the `ruby` command in the terminal.
2. Look up the following methods on ruby doc. Write down what each means and run the methods on the appropriate variable and print.
   1. `String#reverse`
   2. `Float#ceil`
   3. `Numeric#abs`
3. Use an "if statement" to print `Don't Yell` if a string is in all caps. Note: the string needs to be stored in a hardcoded variable before the "if statement". Stretch: let a user type the word in the terminal with `gets.chomp` and use `puts` or `print` to print a prompt.
4. Define a variable with a list of 7 whole numbers in an array. Use `p` to print contents of array.
5. Add 2 new values to the end of the array (after it's been defined) with the `<<` (shovel operator). Then print out the contents using `p`.
6. Print the "first", "third", "last" and "second to last" elements from the array on four seperate lines of code.
7. Write a `times` loop and print each of the elements one at a time from the array.
8. Write a new loop that only prints the elements at odd indices.
9. Make a `sum` variable. Using a times loop, add each number from the array together then print the sum of the numbers in the array.
10. Make a new variable containing a string with at least 7 letters called `original_word`. Make another variable containing an empty string called `weird_word`. Use a times loop to collect the even indexed letters from the original word and add them to the weird word variable. Print the weird word when you are done.
