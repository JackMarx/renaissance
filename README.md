# Renaissance

## Starting instructions

Do not clone `renaissance`, just view it in the browser and follow the instructions.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Make a new directory called `pheonix` (because there's a theme going on) using the `mkdir` command.
3. Use `cd` to move into the new directory.
4. Make a new file for the exercises using the `touch` command.

    stretch goal: If it's easy to do make a repo on github and push the `pheonix` folder up to github. They have changed some things as far as authenticating that we may need to set up later. You can try to figure it out if you have time, but this is one of those areas not to get stuck at the moment.

## Exercises

* exercises_1 - open up the markdown file on github, start exercises in one file named `exercises_1.rb`.
* exercises_2 - open up the markdown file on github, start exercises in one file named `exercises_2.rb`.
